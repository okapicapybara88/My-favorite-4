                <p>I enjoy Playing soccer because It is really fun and also It is athletic. When I first began soccer It was was when I was 3/4 and my dad and a few other dads of my other teamates coached the team and I thought It was pretty cool having my dad as my coach i was playing rec (Recreational) at the time as i grew older i became more competive so then my dad could not coach me any more because he could only teach till so many levels</p>
